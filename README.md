# CatsAppSharp

.NET Android port of the CatsApp project (https://github.com/turdmaggot/CatsApp), which was written in Kotlin. This one uses C#.

As Xamarin.Android is being decomssioned, it will be replaced by MAUI Android AKA .NET Android. This project is created to compare C# with its Kotlin version.

BTW, Native Android rules! :P



## Debugging

Just download Visual Studio, clone this project and run it.
